# Road-Accident-Analysis
This project analyzes road accident data using Microsoft Excel to uncover key trends and causes of accidents across various regions. It highlights critical factors such as vehicle type, time of day, weather, and road conditions. The dashboard includes insights on total accidents, major causes, and safety recommendations based on the findings.

# üö¶ Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## üìä Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. The main objective is to understand the patterns, causes, and impact of road accidents by visualizing key metrics such as accident count, severity, vehicle types involved, environmental and lighting conditions, and human factors like speed and alcohol usage.

By using an interactive dashboard, stakeholders such as policymakers, traffic authorities, and urban planners can gain valuable insights to take effective measures to improve road safety.

## üß† Abstract

Road accidents pose a significant threat to public safety. This project aims to analyze accident data through visual storytelling and data interpretation using Power BI. The dashboard enables users to explore various dimensions such as speed, lighting, environment, vehicle types, and human behavior to uncover root causes of road mishaps. The ability to filter by year and gender adds more depth to the analysis. This project helps in generating actionable insights that can assist in the planning and execution of road safety strategies.

## üìå Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of multiple visual components, each designed to highlight a specific factor affecting road safety.

### 1. **Total Accidents (KPI Card)**
- **Shows**: The total number of recorded accidents (e.g., 1K).
- **Purpose**: Provides a quick, overall view of accident volume.

### 2. **Gender Filter (Slicer)**
- **Shows**: Filter data by Male or Female.
- **Purpose**: Understand gender-wise accident patterns and target specific awareness campaigns.

### 3. **Year Filter (Slicer)**
- **Shows**: Filter data for years (2023, 2024, 2025).
- **Purpose**: Compare year-wise accident trends and effectiveness of past safety measures.

### 4. **Accidents by Speed & Vehicle Type (Bar Chart)**
- **Shows**: Accidents categorized by vehicle (Car: 176, Bus: 173, etc.).
- **Purpose**: Identify which vehicle types are most prone to accidents for targeted regulations.

### 5. **Accidents by Lighting (Donut Chart)**
- **Shows**: Distribution by lighting conditions (Daylight, Dark with/without street lights).
- **Purpose**: Highlight the effect of poor visibility and need for better lighting infrastructure.

### 6. **Crash Severity by Lighting (Grouped Bar Chart)**
- **Shows**: Fatal, Serious, Minor accidents categorized by lighting.
- **Purpose**: Reveal how lighting affects the seriousness of crashes.

### 7. **Impact of Speed on Accident Causes (Bar Chart)**
- **Shows**: Causes such as Overspeeding, Drunk Driving, Mechanical Failure.
- **Purpose**: Uncover leading causes and risky behaviors that require strict monitoring.

### 8. **Road Surface & Lighting Analysis (Grouped Bar Chart)**
- **Shows**: Accidents on different surfaces (Wet, Dry, Snowy) under various lighting conditions.
- **Purpose**: Understand which combinations are most hazardous for drivers.

### 9. **Monthly Accident Trends (Line Chart)**
- **Shows**: Monthly distribution (e.g., Peak in August & October).
- **Purpose**: Identify high-risk periods for targeted interventions.

### 10. **Accidents by Environmental Conditions (Grouped Bar Chart)**
- **Shows**: Impact of weather (Stormy, Fog, Rainy, Clear) under different lighting.
- **Purpose**: Suggest specific weather advisories to reduce accident risks.

### 11. **Speed & Alcohol Influence (Donut Chart)**
- **Shows**: Split of accidents involving Speed & Alcohol vs. Not.
- **Purpose**: Emphasize the significant role of reckless driving in accident rates.

## üîç Key Insights

- **Human factors** such as speed, alcohol, and distraction cause ~50% of accidents.
- **Cars, buses, and motorbikes** are the most involved vehicle types.
- **Lighting conditions** affect both accident count and severity.
- **Seasonal patterns** show spikes in August and October.
- **Environmental conditions** like fog, rain, and storm significantly increase risk.
- **Dry roads** surprisingly see more accidents than icy or wet ones, likely due to higher speeds.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Enforce speed limits** and anti-drunk driving laws with stricter penalties.
- **Improve road lighting** in high-risk dark zones.
- **Increase vehicle inspections** for buses and bikes.
- **Plan seasonal awareness campaigns** in accident-prone months.
- **Educate drivers** about safe driving in different weather and road conditions.
- **Customize interventions by gender and year** using dashboard filters.

## üìå Conclusion

The Road Accident Analysis dashboard provides a clear, data-centric perspective on the diverse causes of road accidents. It uncovers how environmental, vehicular, and behavioral factors interplay to create risks. The dashboard empowers authorities to take preventive action through better infrastructure, targeted enforcement, and public education. With the right interventions based on these insights, we can move toward reducing accident rates and creating safer roads for everyone.
